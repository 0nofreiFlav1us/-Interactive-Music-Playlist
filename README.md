This app makes the music in businesses more interactive, letting customers get involved with the playlist. It uses the YouTube Data API to manage and play songs directly from YouTube. Customers can check out the playlist, add songs (with a limit), see what’s playing right now, and dislike songs. If enough clients dislike a song or if it’s disliked by a certain number of people per day, it gets automatically removed from the playlist for a set amount of time. Clients can sign up, scan in with a code, and get approved to join in. WebSockets handle real-time updates, showing the current song and switching to user-added songs. When no one’s interacting, random songs from the playlist play, but if someone adds a song, it jumps to the front of the queue. If multiple people add songs, they’re played in the order they were added.
